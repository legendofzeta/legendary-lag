To install tkinter on Windows, follow the steps below:

    Open your web browser and go to the Python download page at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

    Download the latest version of Python that is compatible with your Windows operating system. Make sure to select the version that includes tkinter. This is usually indicated in the name of the installation file, for example, "Python 3.9.7 (64-bit) - tk-8.6.10-anaconda".

    Run the installation file and follow the prompts to install Python on your system. Make sure to select the option to add Python to your system PATH during the installation process.

    Once Python is installed, open the Command Prompt or PowerShell on your Windows system.

    Type the following command to verify that Python is installed correctly: python --version

This should display the version of Python that you installed.

To verify that tkinter is installed, type the following command: python -m tkinter

This should open a window with various widgets, indicating that tkinter is installed correctly.

That's it! You have successfully installed tkinter on your Windows system.

Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell on your Windows system.

Once you are in the directory where lag.py is saved, type the following command to run the program: python3 lag.py

This will execute the Python script and output any results to the Command Prompt or PowerShell window.
